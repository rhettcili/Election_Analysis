# Election_Analysis
An analysis of the election results to measure the following:

    The voter turnout for each county
    The percentage of votes from each county out of the total voter count
    The county with the highest turnout

The purpose of this challenge is to better understand not just the winner of the election, but where the votes are coming from. A possible use for this kind of information would be where to focus campaign efforts based on highest voter turnouts.

## Summery 
With just some small modifications to the script, this code could be used to measure the results of other elections as well. You could simply change the script to find the county with the lowest vote percentage, to better understand where some campaign resources may be being wasted. Alternatively, you could modify the script to have it measure the percentage of any given county's vote went to each candidate.
